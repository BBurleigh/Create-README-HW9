## Contributions
Aside from myself, some assistance from tutors as well as using one website (opensource.org) served me well in creating this app.  In addition, a GitHub repo by markwilson107 (https://github.com/markwilson107/Readme-Generator/blob/main/index.js) was helpful in learning how to code the badges, links, and text relating to the badges.
